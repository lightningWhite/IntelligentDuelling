# Intelligent Duelling

## Overview
Intelligent Duelling is a game that allows a player to select his or her 
character with specific starting strengths, equipment, abilities, weaknesses,
and hit points. Each character and opponent has attacks and defenses specific 
to itself. The player will progress through various duels gaining money,
skills, additional hitpoints, and more difficult opponents. 

## Gameplay
During the duel, the player who will make the first move will be randomly
selected. Once selected, the first player will submit two moves. These moves
can consist of an attack and a defense, an attack and an attack, a defense and 
a defense, or a defense and an attack. The second opponent will suffer the 
blow of the first move, but be able to choose two actions to submit in response.
The first action of the attacked should be whatever is thought to be the best
attack for what is predicted to be the attacker's second move. 

For example, if an attacker weilding a sword submits "jab" and "block left,"
then the monster will be jabbed losing hitpoints. The monster, weilding
a club, could then submit "swing left" and "swing down." The result of this 
would be a successful hit on the attacker's right side (since he was 
blocking his left), causing him to lose hitpoints. Play would continue and
the attacker would choose a move he thought best to defend against the 
monster's soon-to-be inflicted second attack. If he chose "step right" and
"swing left," then the monster's "swing down" would be a miss. The monster 
would then choose how to respond to the soon-to-be inflicted attack. If he
chose to "step right," then the attacker's "swing left" would be a hit. 
Gameplay would continue until one of the player's hitpoints runs out, leaving
the victor to claim the spoils and continue to the next round.
