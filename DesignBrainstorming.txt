Design Brainstorming

1. Character Selection
1.5. Weapon Selection
2. Opponent Selection
3. Design Character
   - What are the attributes?
      - Name
      - Weapon - A set max damage infliction? Determines the moves that are possible?
      - Hitpoints - How much life the character has.
      - Speed - Increased probability of getting the hit or the block (Can't inflict as much damage per attack - opposite of strength)
      - Strength - Higher strength equals higher amount of damage that is inflicted (Lower probability of getting a hit - opposite of speed)
      - Special Power - Some special ability. This must deplete the energy or something
      - Armor/Defense - Causes the probability of a hit from an opponent to go down. Deffending for a move should increase energy levels.
      - Energy Level - The higher the energy, the greater the probability for a high attack. Low energy equals missed attacks.
      - Endurance - The max amount of energy the player can have.
      - Offesive Moves - The attacks available to the character with the chosen weapon. I'll need the same number of attacks for each character.
      - Deffensive Moves - The defensive moves available to the character with the chosen armor.
4. Randomly select first attacker.
