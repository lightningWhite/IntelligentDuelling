Design Brainstorming

- Character Selection
- Weapon Selection
- Opponent Selection
- Design Character
   - What are the attributes?
      - Name
      - Weapon - A set max damage infliction? Determines the moves that are possible?
      - Hitpoints - How much life the character has.
      - Speed - Increased probability of getting the hit or the block (Can't inflict as much damage per attack - opposite of strength)
      - Strength - Higher strength equals higher amount of damage that is inflicted (Lower probability of getting a hit - opposite of speed)
      - Special Power - Some special ability. This must deplete the energy or something
      - Armor/Defense - Causes the probability of a hit from an opponent to go down. Deffending for a move should increase energy levels.
      - Energy Level - The higher the energy, the greater the probability for a high attack. Low energy equals missed attacks.
      - Endurance - The max amount of energy the player can have.
      - Offesive Moves - The attacks available to the character with the chosen weapon. I'll need the same number of attacks for each character.
      - Deffensive Moves - The defensive moves available to the character with the chosen armor.
      - Shield - Determines the defenseive moves. Has an integrity level. Each hit decreases it. Each turn without a hit increases its level.
      - Position - Where the character is located in the battle zone. (*Maybe don't do position...)

- Randomly select first attacker.
- There needs to be a main game loop once the duel starts.
      - loop      
            - Player 1 selects two moves. (Like attack and defend)
            - Player 1's first move (attack) is applied to Player 2's second move (Nothing for the very first time, defend for the second). 
            - Player 2 selects two moves. (Like attack and defend)
            - Player 2's first move (Attack) is applied to Player 1's second move. (Defend)
            

- I think the character needs to handle the output of its attack  
   - If player 1 selects swipe right, then the calculate attack method of the player needs to be invoked.
      - This method should first look at the weapon's damage amount
      - Then look at the player's strength level and increase/decrease the weapon's damage amount based off of that
      - Take the resulting largest possible damage amount
         - Calculate the percent of the total energy that's available (say it's down to 30% of max)
         - Set the bell curve center at 15%. This will make it so most likely the attack will fall in that range.
            -  Basically, I want a lower energy level to result in a weaker attack amount 
         - Apply the speed level as a probability of getting a hit (higher speed is more likely to get a hit. Note that speed is incorporated in the attack amount through the strenght. They are inversely proportional.)

- I may want to have the other attacked modify the created attack based off it its speed and armor.

- Process of a combat interaction
   - Attacker uses its characteristics to create an attack amount 
      - Take weapon damage amount
      - Increase/decrease weapon damage amount based off of strength/speed
         - This represents the max attack amount
      - Use the current energy level percent to determine the mean value of the max attack of a numpy random gauss and use some standard deviation (perhaps the speed affects the standard deviation used?)
         - The value returned is the attack amount to be dealt
      - Using the move, query to obtain a list of moves that could block it
   - The blocking moves are compared with the defender's move.
      - If the defender's move is a blocking move, no damage is applied
      - If the defender's move is not a blocking move, apply the attack
         - Using the defender's armor amount, decrease the attack amount applied. 
      

- The move you chose affects the speed (probability of the next move). Swinging left twice makes it less likely you'll get a hit, because it's slower to move the weapon back. This will take affect by halving the speed or something.
- Use a table. If it's a block, no damage is applied. Both characters calulate their attack amount and if it's a hit, the damage is applied to the other character.
- Both players could get damaged.
- To lookup the result of the attack (hit or block) take the first attacker's move, return the list of moves that block it, then check if the defender's move is one of those. If so, the attack was blocked. Otherwise, it was a hit.
   - Make a map or something that maps attacks to lists of blocking moves.

- If you do a defensive move, you increase in energy. Attacking moves decrease energy.

- Display window:
   - informs player of past result. This needs to include the other player's move applied. Maybe have an option of displaying all the moves in the duel of the other player so far as well as your moves.
